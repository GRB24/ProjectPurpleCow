# How to build and run
# Prerequisites
- Create a .env file matching the .env.example 
(Normally you would not share keys or commit this information even in a .env.example, but since this is an assessment and they are not really secrets it is ok.)
- Install node
- Have docker installed (for running with Docker only)

# Run with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Run with npm
npm start
